Abstraction Core Filesystem Initializer
---------------------------------------
- Contains command files that execute the tasks to setup abstraction environment
- Initialization sets up core git-repository from fresh (removes .git directory and reinits + adds modules)
- Initiailization removes also all of its commands by the end of process to prevent accidentially reinitialization
